# gSkills

My original goal is to understand the source code of [gRPC-go](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go). When researching the source code, I found a lots of coding skills which deserved to be noted for later reference. All content are golang and gRPC-go related. 

## Content 

### [Sending Request](request.md)
### [Reply with Response](response.md)
### [Interceptor](interceptor.md)
* [Interceptor chain execution flow](interceptor.md#interceptor-chain-execution-flow)   
* [Launch Intercetor](interceptor.md#launch-interceptor)  
* [Use Interceptor](interceptor.md#use-interceptor)

## Reading material
The following books help me building a solid fundation for http2 and gRPC. They answer a lot of questions about Why ,What and some part of How, while gSkills purely focus on How to implement them in gRPC.

* [HTTP/2 in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/http2-in-action?query=http2)
* [gRPC: Up and Running](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/grpc-up-and/9781492058328/)
* [Learning HTTP/2](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-http2/9781491962435/)
* [gPRC doc](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/doc)
